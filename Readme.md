# `PayBoost` : Paytm Clone in HTML and Tailwind

---

## Description
The `PayBoost` project is a web-based application designed to mimic the user interface of the original Paytm platform. The project is built using `HTML` and `Tailwind CSS`, making it fully responsive for major screen sizes. The application also includes all the icons and hover functionalities available on the Paytm platform, providing a seamless experience for the end-user.
<br> <br> 
The front-end of the Paytm clone project is designed to match the Paytm user interface, including the use of `Paytm's signature colors and fonts`. The UI is divided into several sections, including the header, footer, and the main content area, where users can perform various transactions, such as mobile recharges, bill payments, and online shopping.
<br> <br> 
The header of the application includes the *Paytm logo, search bar, and various icons* that allow users to navigate to different sections of the platform, such as the wallet, bank transfer, and shopping. The main content area of the application is designed to provide users with an easy-to-use interface for performing various transactions.
